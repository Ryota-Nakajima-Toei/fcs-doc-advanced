"Following similar software, FCS semi-automatically creates facial "
"animation from footage for any rig by allowing the user to provide "
"pairwise reference of facial expression of the actor and the character in"
" the form of [Profiles](#profiles)."

msgid ""
"After creating enough profiles, FCS automatically establishes a "
"relationship between the facial expression of the actor and that of the "
"character. This is often an iterative process that rely on the user to "
"provide more and more profiles to increase the accuracy of the "
"prediction."

"In general, accuracy of the animation would tend to worsen when drastic "
"movement is involved, camera blur etc. In this case we recommend adding "
"frames that failed to produce the desired result as profile, manually "
"correct the rig parameters and reprocess."

"Profile refers to a paired data of a single image of an actor, and the "
"corresponding character, rigged to express the same facial expression as "
"the actor in the image. This is created using FCS by selecting particular"
" frame from a video, and rigging the character in Maya."

"As a general rule of thumb, we recommend filming a Range of Motion (ROM) "
"video prior to the actual filming. A ROM video should cover a wide range "
"of facial expression that the actor can do. It is not strictly necessary "
"but we find that using a ROM video in production often leads to time "
"saving, especially when the amount of footage that has to be processed is"
" large. The time saving would be less significant if you are processing "
"only a small amount of footage."

"With your purchase of FCS comes with a PDF containing approximately 50 "
"facial expressions that you can use for the ROM video, it is meant for "
"guidance but you can always use your own ROM facial expressions.  We "
"refer to profiles with the facial expression in the PDF the baseline "
"profiles collectively, and often use them as a benchmarking baseline."
