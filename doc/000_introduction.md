# Introduction
This website hosts more advanced topics for FCS, including benchmarks, tracking results, and more.  

### Who is this for?
This page is for users who are considering purchasing a license, or already purchased a license. Here we provide you an easier way to understand the quality of animation that they can and cannot expect from FCS, and the associated effort required to achieve the level of quality they require. Evaluating a new piece of software takes time, and we are here to make it slightly easier. 

### How does FCS work?

If you wish to learn how to use FCS, we have a separate full length online manual in English and Japanese [here](https://zukunfcs.github.io/fcs-doc).


### What does this website contain?
As of now, this document contains three sections.

1. Challenging scenarios
