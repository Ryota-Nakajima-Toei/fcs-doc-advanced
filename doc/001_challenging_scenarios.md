# Challenging scenarions
This page shows the results of challenging scenarios, such as processing heavily occluded videos.

### Background
In the case when you are processing videos that is heavily occluded, by facial hair and other external factors, our tracking will not work as well as it does. This is an area where we are actively working on, nonetheless, you can still improve the final quality of the animation by simply adding more profiles to the gallery. The most effective way to improve the animation quality of a particular video is to add more profiles from within the video itself.

### Scenario Detail
In this showcase, we selected and rigged 50 profiles from the ROM video. Then, using only the 50 ROM profiles, we generate the results in Baseline. The occluded region tends to produce less-than-ideal animation results. \
This can be mitigated by adding profiles from within the video. We showcase how the performance improves when you add a number of profiles. We can see that the quality of the animation tends to improve. \
Additionally, we showcase the results of processing these videos using only the profiles from within them (i.e., no ROM profiles).
